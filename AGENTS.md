# Agent Instructions

## Remote connection

- Ensure the `origin` remote points to `https://github.com/getson7070/ERP-BERHAN.git`.
- Authenticate pushes using the `getson7070` account with a personal access token.
- If the remote is missing, configure it with:

  `git remote add origin https://getson7070:<PAT>@github.com/getson7070/ERP-BERHAN.git`

- After running required checks, push updates to the `main` branch:

  `git push origin HEAD:main`

## UI/UX & Feature Checklist
When modifying templates or front-end behavior, confirm the following:
- All templates use industry-standard Bootstrap layouts with client-side validation and responsive design.
- Dashboards remain clean and modular with smart navigation to ensure consistency and familiarity.
- Interfaces support responsive design and mobile-friendly actions.
- The broader system roadmap accounts for:
  - Task & workflow automation
  - Data entry optimization
  - Visualization & reports
  - Role-based access control
  - Error handling & guidance
  - Calendar integration
  - Chat/collaboration within the ERP
  - Offline mode with automatic sync
  - AI-powered recommendations

## Project Phases
1. Foundation & Security
   - Strengthen core authentication, authorization, and data protection.
   - Centralize secrets and enforce HTTPS/TOTP.
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC).
2. Database & Infrastructure
   - Ensure migration safety, backups, and cloud readiness.
   - Adopt Alembic migrations and pooled connections.
   - Provide backup and restore tooling.
3. Automation & Analytics
   - Automate tender lifecycle, reporting, and scheduled jobs.
   - Expand tender automation.
   - Build analytics dashboard.
4. UI/UX Modernization
   - Apply industry-standard layouts and client-side validation.
   - Refactor templates to responsive Bootstrap.
   - Ensure all templates extend `base.html` or `base_auth.html` and forms use `needs-validation` with `novalidate`.
5. Monitoring & Reliability
   - Introduce observability, crash handling, and self-healing.
   - Add structured logging and health checks.
   - Automate backups and restart policies.
6. Feature Expansion
   - Extend ERP functionality for broader coverage.
   - Enhance HR and document generation.

## Implementation Roadmap
1. Clean `db.py` and `erp/utils.py` by removing conflict markers and consolidating the PostgreSQL implementation with Redis caching.
2. Replace SQLite-style `?` placeholders in SQL queries with `%s` and update connection logic to use SQLAlchemyâ€™s parameter binding.
3. Run migrations and regression tests across orders, tenders, and analytics modules to confirm PostgreSQL compatibility.
4. Create scaffolding for finance, HR, CRM, procurement, and project management under `erp/routes/` with corresponding templates and tests.
5. Define database schemas and migrations for these modules, ensuring each includes `org_id` for multi-tenant isolation.
6. Update navigation and role-based dashboards to expose new modules based on user permissions.
7. Introduce responsive components and feature parity for mobile by auditing all templates under `templates/`.
8. Implement language packs and a locale selector using Flask-Babel; ensure translations for core pages.
9. Add user-customizable widgets and saved searches within dashboard templates.
10. Introduce FastAPI or Flask-RESTful endpoints under `erp/api/` for orders, inventory, and tenders.
11. Implement webhook support and SDK documentation; integrate with at least one accounting or payment service.
12. Add OAuth2 flows for external systems to authenticate and interact with the ERP.
13. Develop a report builder UI in `templates/analytics/` allowing filter selection and export to PDF/Excel.
14. Add compliance report generators (e.g., tax, HR) in `erp/routes/analytics.py` with supporting migrations.
15. Integrate an anomaly-detection model (e.g., scikit-learn) for sales and inventory forecasting.
16. Implement SSO/OAuth2 providers (e.g., Keycloak) and enforce HTTPS/TLS everywhere.
17. Enable database encryption at rest (PostgreSQL TDE or disk-level encryption) and document key rotation.
18. Expand audit logging to capture every CRUD action with timestamp, user, IP, and store logs in an immutable table.
19. Provide Docker/Kubernetes manifests for API, worker, and bot services with load balancing and failover.
20. Document upgrade procedures using Alembic migrations and rolling deploys.
21. Set up CI/CD pipelines that run tests, linting, and security scans before deployment.
22. Implement a plugin framework allowing modules to register new routes and jobs dynamically.
23. Integrate a task automation engine (e.g., Celery workflows) for reminders and approvals.
24. Evaluate ML libraries for forecasting or chatbot capabilities and expose hooks for AI modules.

## Additional Recommendations
1. UI/UX Review: After implementing changes, run usability tests and lint CSS/JS to ensure responsive design meets industry standards.
2. Compatibility Checks: Update unit and integration tests for all affected modules (auth, db, templates, service worker, etc.).
3. Security Considerations: Perform static analysis and penetration testing around token handling, RLS bypasses, and offline storage.
4. Database Standards: Add migrations and enforce PostgreSQL best practices (constraints, indexes, retention policies); regularly back up and test restores.
