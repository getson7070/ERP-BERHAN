# MIGRATIONS_TODO
There were multiple Alembic heads earlier. We now automate repair + upgrade
in one step, and we committed a merge revision (`d6c63256408b_auto_merge_heads.py`)
to keep the lineage linear. The Docker entrypoint runs the fixer automatically
(unless `SKIP_AUTO_MIGRATION_REPAIR=1`), and you can run it manually after
containers are up (or locally with env vars set):

```
python tools/repair_migration_heads.py
```

Use `--dry-run` to preview actions without modifying the database.

Tender-workflow note: the repository no longer includes an
`*_add_tender_workflow.py` migration (for example
`2b3c4d5e6f7a_add_tender_workflow.py`). The swap instructions that used to
mention it are obsolete—follow the in-repo migrations as-is.
