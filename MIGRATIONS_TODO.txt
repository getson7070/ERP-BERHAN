# MIGRATIONS_TODO
There were multiple Alembic heads earlier. We now automate repair + upgrade
in one step. The Docker entrypoint runs the fixer automatically (unless
`SKIP_AUTO_MIGRATION_REPAIR=1`), and you can run it manually after
containers are up (or locally with env vars set):

```
python tools/repair_migration_heads.py
```

Use `--dry-run` to preview actions without modifying the database.
