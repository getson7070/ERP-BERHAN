# MIGRATIONS_TODO
There were multiple Alembic heads earlier. Run once after containers are up:
1) docker compose run --rm web bash -lc "alembic heads"
2) docker compose run --rm web bash -lc "alembic merge -m 'merge heads' <head1> <head2> [<headN>]"
3) docker compose run --rm web bash -lc "alembic upgrade head"
