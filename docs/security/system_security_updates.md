# System Security and Operational Enhancements

## Security & AppSec
- Expand automated security checks to cover OWASP ASVS fully.
- Adopt in‑toto or Sigstore for supply‑chain attestation.
- Produce Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) in both CycloneDX and SPDX formats.
- Codify incident response playbooks to reach higher NIST 800‑53 coverage.

## Secrets Management
- Centralize secret rotation in a cloud KMS/Secrets Manager with granular IAM.
- Implement automated secret expiration alerts.
- Enforce “no secret in code” policies through pre‑commit hooks.

## Cloud, Containers & Deployment
- Align container hardening with NIST 800‑190 and CNCF guidance (image signing, runtime scanning).
- Integrate AWS Well‑Architected reviews into release gating.
- Standardize TLS 1.2+ and adopt mutual TLS where feasible.

## Web Security Headers / Browser Isolation
- Monitor Content Security Policy (CSP) Level 3 for emerging directives.
- Enforce COOP, COEP, and CORP on all user‑facing applications.
- Maintain strict Referrer‑Policy and apply Subresource Integrity for all third‑party assets.

## AuthN/Z & Identity
- Integrate Proof‑Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) and WebAuthn flows.
- Apply NIST 800‑63 guidance for passwords and multi-factor authentication.
- Implement key rotation and JWT revocation strategies.

## Privacy & Compliance
- Pursue ISO 27001/27701 and SOC 2 certifications.
- Formalize GDPR and CCPA data‑handling procedures.
- Conduct privacy impact assessments for new features.

## SRE / Reliability / Observability
- Define Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) with error budgets.
- Adopt OpenTelemetry for unified tracing, metrics, and logging.
- Maintain runbooks and post‑mortem templates aligned with Google SRE best practices.

## Software Quality & Maintainability
- Enforce statement and branch coverage gates.
- Incorporate mutation testing for critical modules.
- Standardize static analysis and type checks in continuous integration.
- Ensure semantic‑versioned releases using conventional commits.

## Data & Database
- Conduct indexing and auditing aligned with PostgreSQL benchmarks.
- Document Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) targets with verified recovery drills.
- Continually assess normalization and query performance.

## Performance & Front‑End
- Track Core Web Vitals and Apdex scores through automated tooling.
- Implement aggressive HTTP caching with ETag and cache‑control headers.
- Optimize UI assets for faster load times to meet modern UX standards.

## Accessibility & UX
- Audit against WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.
- Adopt ARIA best practices in UI components.
- Run usability testing to confirm the interface meets industry expectations.

## APIs & Interoperability
- Provide full OpenAPI 3.1 specifications.
- Implement JSON Schema validation.
- Deliver signed webhooks or mutual TLS for secure WebSocket endpoints with proper authentication.

## Messaging, Email & Security Adjacent
- Configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC with reporting.
- Standardize message broker security (AMQP/MQTT) with mutual TLS and per‑topic ACLs.

## Documentation, QMS & HR/Process
- Establish ISO 9001‑style document control processes.
- Track HR metrics per ISO 30414.
- Maintain current architecture and operational documentation for every feature.
