# Remote Push Status

This environment does not have a Git remote configured for the ERP-BERHAN repository. As a result, no commits from the local `work` branch have been transmitted to GitHub. Configure a remote explicitly (for example, `git remote add origin <url>`) and run `git push` to synchronize with GitHub.

For security, repository credentials should never be embedded directly in commands or stored in source control. Use secure credential helpers or environment-specific secret storage when adding remotes.
