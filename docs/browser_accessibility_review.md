# Cross-Browser and Accessibility Audit

This checklist guides teams through a holistic review of UI/UX, security, and data integrity. Run it after major UI changes or on a scheduled basis.

## 1. Prepare a Browser Test Matrix
- Enumerate supported desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and mobile browsers (Chrome on Android, Safari on iOS). Include legacy versions still used by customers. The current versioned list lives in [browser_matrix.md](browser_matrix.md).
- Use services such as BrowserStack, Sauce Labs, or Selenium Grid to automate regression suites. Capture screenshots or video to confirm consistent layout and behaviour.
- Ensure every tested page loads over HTTPS and is free of blocked resources by the Content Security Policy.

## 2. Run Automated Accessibility Checks
- Integrate Lighthouse, axe-core, or WAVE into CI (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
- Configure CI to fail when new WCAG issues (contrast, ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, focus order) are introduced.
- Keep rule sets up to date and log violations to track progress over time.

## 3. Conduct Manual Accessibility Testing
- Navigate with keyboard only and verify logical tab order and visible focus states.
- Test with screen readers like VoiceOver and NVDA to confirm labels, live-region announcements, and ARIA usage.
- For dynamic content (AJAX or SPA), ensure updates are announced to assistive technologies.

## 4. Assess Service Worker & CSP
- Confirm the service worker runs over HTTPS, caches only intended assets, and provides graceful offline fallbacks.
- Validate Content Security Policy headers with tools such as Google CSP Evaluator to avoid blocking required scripts or styles while guarding against XSS and data injection.
- Review the service worker scope and CSP headers for security integrity.

## 5. Review UI/UX Against Industry Standards
- Cross-check components against a design system (Material Design, Human Interface Guidelines, etc.) for typography, spacing, and behaviour.
- Verify responsiveness across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints so content does not overlap or clip.
- Ensure colours, icons, and micro-interactions align with brand and accessibility guidelines.

## 6. Validate Database Integrity & Performance
- Run schema migrations in staging and audit for drift; confirm data consistency with new UI features.
- Profile queries for index usage and cache hits to keep latency low under load.
- Recheck RBAC and row-level security rules to avoid exposing restricted data.

## 7. Document and Iterate
- Record results from browser and accessibility tests, noting severity and impact. Manual findings should be logged in [accessibility_audit_log.md](accessibility_audit_log.md).
- Prioritise fixes based on user impact and security risk.
- Re-run the audit after significant UI/UX changes, dependency upgrades, or security patches.

## 8. Ongoing Maintenance Tips
- Keep test scripts, accessibility configs, and UI guidelines in version control and review them regularly.
- Schedule periodic (e.g., quarterly) audits to stay current with browser versions and assistive technologies.
- Revalidate service worker and CSP settings after each release and monitor for regressions in CI.
- Continue running database integrity checks and query profiling; monitor logs for anomalies.
