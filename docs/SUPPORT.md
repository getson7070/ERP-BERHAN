# Support & Community Guidelines

This document outlines the support policies and community guidelines for the ERP-BERHAN system. It ensures that users have clear expectations around service-level agreements (SLA), issue reporting, and avenues for community engagement.

## Support Policies

- **Service-Level Agreements (SLA)**: Provide defined response and resolution times for different support tiers (e.g., standard, premium). Standard support aims to acknowledge tickets within 24 hours and resolve within 3–5 business days depending on severity. Premium support offers faster response/resolution times and priority handling.

- **Support Channels**: Use a dedicated support portal or help desk (e.g., Jira Service Desk) as the primary channel for reporting issues and requesting assistance. Additional channels include email support and a community forum.

- **Issue Templates**: Provide standardized templates for bug reports, feature requests, and security disclosures. Templates should include fields for description, reproduction steps, severity, and expected vs actual behavior.

- **Knowledge Base & FAQ**: Maintain a searchable knowledge base and frequently asked questions (FAQ) to help users find solutions without opening tickets. Include common configuration steps, troubleshooting tips, and how‑to guides.

- **Training & Onboarding**: Offer onboarding materials, tutorials, and webinars to help new users adopt the system. Provide migration guides for moving from legacy systems and highlight best practices.

## Community Engagement

- **Discussion Forum**: Create an open discussion forum where users can ask questions, share tips, and collaborate. Moderators should encourage respectful and constructive dialogue.

- **Contribution Guidelines**: Document how to contribute to the project, including coding standards, pull request requirements, and code of conduct. Define how new plugins or extensions can be submitted and reviewed.

- **Release Notes & Changelog**: Publish detailed release notes with each new version, highlighting new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes. Maintain a public changelog for transparency.

- **Feedback Loops**: Gather feedback through surveys, feature request boards, and community calls. Prioritize improvements based on user input and communicate roadmaps openly.

## Support Escalation

- **Severity Levels**:
  - *Severity 1 (Critical)*: System is down or data loss occurs; resolution target within 24 hours.
  - *Severity 2 (High)*: Major functionality degraded; temporary workaround available; resolution within 2–3 business days.
  - *Severity 3 (Medium)*: Minor functionality impacted; resolution in the next release cycle.
  - *Severity 4 (Low)*: Cosmetic issues or enhancement requests; scheduled into future planning.

- **Escalation Path**: If initial response does not resolve the issue within the SLA, users can request escalation. Escalations are routed to senior support engineers and, if necessary, product leadership.

## Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors and users to adhere to a community code of conduct. Participants should be respectful, considerate, and constructive. Harassment, discrimination, or abusive behavior will not be tolerated.
