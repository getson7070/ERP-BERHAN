# Incident Response Playbook

This directory contains the organization's incident response (IR) playbooks. These documents define roles and responsibilities, communication templates, severity classifications and triage procedures used when responding to security and reliability incidents. Each asset aligns to NIST 800-53 IR controls and references the evidence locations required for audits (for example, [`logs/restore_drill.log`](../../logs/restore_drill.log) and the ASVS traceability matrix).

## Contents

- **roles.md** – describes the key roles involved in incident response (e.g., Incident Commander, Communications Lead, Subject Matter Experts, and Scribe) and their responsibilities.
- **comms_templates.md** – reusable communication templates for internal and external stakeholders (initial alerts, status updates, post‑incident announcements).
- **severity_levels.md** – defines severity categories (Low, Medium, High, Critical) with impact criteria and required response timelines.
- **triage_tree.md** – a decision tree guiding responders through detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery and post‑mortem review.

Use these resources to ensure incidents are handled consistently and effectively.
