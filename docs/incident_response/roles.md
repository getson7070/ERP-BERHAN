# Incident Response Roles

- **Incident Commander** – coordinates the overall response, makes decisions and assigns tasks, and records the NIST 800-53 controls invoked during the event (IR-4/IR-5/IR-6) in the postmortem package.
- **Communications Lead** – drafts and sends incident updates to internal/external stakeholders and manages status pages.
- **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)** – provide technical expertise on the affected system and support analysis and remediation.
- **Scribe** – documents the timeline, actions and decisions for accountability and post‑incident reviews, linking evidence such as [`logs/restore_drill.log`](../../logs/restore_drill.log) and communication templates used.
- **Operations & Support** – triages customer support tickets, monitors operational impact and liaises with affected users.

Individuals may fulfill multiple roles depending on the size and severity of the incident.
