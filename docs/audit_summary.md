# Initial Audit Summary

This document captures the results of an early audit of the ERP-BERHAN project when the codebase was largely undeveloped. The audit rated the repository **2/10** overall, noting that most features existed only as plans in documentation with little executable code.

## Category Scores (0â€“3)
| Area | Score | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Functional Fit | 0 | Modules described in README but not implemented. |
| UI/UX & Accessibility | 1 | Basic Bootstrap layout; lacks mobile and accessibility testing. |
| Performance & Scale | 0 | No load or concurrency tests yet. |
| Security (App & Data) | 1 | Plans for SSO/MFA/RLS but minimal code. |
| Privacy & Compliance | 0 | Policies and logging not implemented. |
| Data Quality & Integrity | 1 | Preliminary checks, but no enforcement. |
| Reporting & Analytics | 1 | Report builder scaffold only. |
| Integrations & Extensibility | 0 | No external connectors in place. |
| Telegram/Chatbot Path | 0 | Bot framework not started. |
| Files & Storage | 1 | Basic backup scripts, no object storage. |
| Deployability & DevOps | 1 | README references Docker/K8s, no CI/CD. |
| Reliability & DR | 0 | No failover or DR runbooks. |
| Observability | 1 | Prometheus metrics stubbed in app factory. |
| Testing & Quality | 0 | No automated tests at the time of audit. |
| Governance & Change Management | 0 | Lacks release notes and change control. |
| Cost & Commercials | 0 | No cost or licensing model defined. |
| Documentation & Training | 1 | Roadmap exists; lacks user/admin guides. |

## Improvement Plan
- Implement missing modules with blueprints and database schemas.
- Establish CI pipeline running linting, security scans, and pytest.
- Add integration tests and load testing scripts.
- Define security hardening steps: OAuth2, MFA, row-level security.
- Expand documentation for deployment, backups, and training.

The scores will be revisited as development progresses.

## Recent Audits (Aug 2025)
The repository has since evolved substantially. Two independent audits produced diverging results:

- **ChatGPT audit:** Recognized implemented Flask modules, tests, and CI workflows, but flagged gaps in reverse-proxy rate limiting, comprehensive CI coverage, disaster-recovery drills, data-governance policies, query-efficiency metrics, and automated JWT secret rotation.
- **Grok audit:** Reported an empty or missing codebase, likely due to inspection errors. Its findings do not match the current repository state.

### Outstanding Gaps
1. Enforce edge rate limiting and track 429 metrics for REST, GraphQL, and webhook endpoints.
2. Extend CI to run lint, type checks, tests with coverage, dependency and container scans, and K8s validations on every push/PR.
3. Document RPO/RTO targets and schedule regular backup restore drills.
4. Finalize data-retention rules with column-level lineage and OLAP export paths.
5. Add query-count tests/N+1 guards and expose cache hit-rate gauges.
6. Automate JWT secret rotation via `JWT_SECRET_ID` with audited scripts.

These items should be prioritized in upcoming sprints to close the precision gaps identified by the audit.
