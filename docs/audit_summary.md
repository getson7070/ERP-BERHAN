# Initial Audit Summary

This document captures the results of an early audit of the ERP-BERHAN project when the codebase was largely undeveloped. The audit rated the repository **2/10** overall, noting that most features existed only as plans in documentation with little executable code.

Berhan Pharma SOP and corporate policy documents live in `docs/BERHAN_SOP_PACK.md`.

## Category Scores (0–3)
| Area | Score | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Functional Fit | 0 | Modules described in readme but not implemented. |
| UI/UX & Accessibility | 1 | Basic Bootstrap layout; lacks mobile and accessibility testing. |
| Performance & Scale | 0 | No load or concurrency tests yet. |
| Security (App & Data) | 1 | Plans for SSO/MFA/RLS but minimal code. |
| Privacy & Compliance | 0 | Policies and logging not implemented. |
| Data Quality & Integrity | 1 | Preliminary checks, but no enforcement. |
| Reporting & Analytics | 1 | Report builder scaffold only. |
| Integrations & Extensibility | 0 | No external connectors in place. |
| Telegram/Chatbot Path | 0 | Bot framework not started. |
| Files & Storage | 1 | Basic backup scripts, no object storage. |
| Deployability & DevOps | 1 | readme references Docker/K8s, no CI/CD. |
| Reliability & DR | 0 | No failover or DR runbooks. |
| Observability | 1 | Prometheus metrics stubbed in app factory. |
| Testing & Quality | 0 | No automated tests at the time of audit. |
| Governance & Change Management | 0 | Lacks release notes and change control. |
| Cost & Commercials | 0 | No cost or licensing model defined. |
| Documentation & Training | 1 | Roadmap exists; lacks user/admin guides. |

## Improvement Plan
- Implement missing modules with blueprints and database schemas.
- Establish CI pipeline running linting, security scans, and pytest.
- Add integration tests and load testing scripts.
- Define security hardening steps: OAuth2, MFA, row-level security.
- Expand documentation for deployment, backups, and training.

The scores will be revisited as development progresses.

## Recent Audits (Aug 2025)
Two independent audits produced diverging results:

- **ChatGPT audit:** Recognized implemented modules, tests and CI workflows but flagged missing reverse-proxy rate limiting, full CI coverage, disaster-recovery drills, data-governance policies, query-efficiency metrics and automated JWT secret rotation.
- **Grok audit:** Reported an empty repository, likely due to inspection failure; its findings do not reflect the current codebase.

### Remediation Priorities
1. Enforce rate limiting in the ingress layer and export 429 counters.
2. Expand CI to run ruff/flake8, black check, mypy, pytest (≥80% coverage), bandit, pip-audit, secret scan, Docker build + Trivy, kube-linter and ZAP baseline on every push/PR.
3. Document RPO/RTO targets and schedule periodic restore drills.
4. Publish data retention and PII lineage policy and integrate masking into analytics exports.
5. Instrument query-count and cache hit/miss gauges for performance monitoring.
6. Automate JWT secret rotation keyed by `JWT_SECRET_ID` with audit logging.

## Current Status

The repository has since implemented several of the planned controls:

- Reverse-proxy and Flask rate limiting with `rate_limit_rejections_total` metrics.
- A full CI pipeline running linting, typing, tests with coverage, dependency and secret scans, Docker/Kubernetes validation, and ZAP/pa11y checks on every push or pull request.
- Disaster-recovery runbooks with weekly restore drills meeting a 15‑minute RPO and one‑hour RTO.
- A data-retention matrix and `DataLineage` model tracking column origins and PII masking requirements.
- Query efficiency tests and cache hit‑rate gauges to detect N+1 patterns and performance regressions.
- Automated JWT secret rotation via `scripts/rotate_jwt_secret.py` with audit logging.
- Structured JSON logging with request IDs and health/ready probes; report builder guarded by a feature flag.
- HR tables enforce row-level security and schema constraints; nightly backup
  jobs produce checksum-verified dumps.

These changes significantly raise the project’s maturity relative to the initial audit and address many of the highlighted gaps.

## September 2025 Audit Scorecard

Overall score: **8.3 / 10**

| Dimension | Score | Highlights | Gaps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Security | 8.7 | CI enforces linting, type checks, scans, container signing | Mixed auth decorators; centralize authorization |
| User-friendliness | 7.8 | Clean Bootstrap layout, report builder UI | HR pages still have placeholders |
| Database structure | 7.6 | Dedicated KPI tables and retention jobs | Some routes use raw SQL from request context |
| Code quality | 8.1 | Modular blueprints and documented discovery | Inconsistent helper usage |
| Web access quality | 8.2 | Distinct blueprints with clear URL prefixes | Placeholder endpoints may confuse users |
| Integration | 8.5 | CI pipeline builds, tests, scans, and runs ZAP/pa11y | Ensure Celery broker/backends documented |
| Inter-function communication | 8.2 | Coordinated analytics tasks | HR pages not fully wired to data-entry flows |
| Overall performance | 8.3 | Separate perf workflow with scheduled tests | Need DB indices and query profiling |

### Top Recommendations
1. Unify auth/permission decorators.
2. Finish HR workflows with forms, validations, and persistence.
3. Replace ad-hoc SQL with SQLAlchemy models/services.
4. Stabilize report builder via persistence, whitelists, and feature flags.
5. Polish style, add smoke tests, document user flows.
6. Add structured logging, request IDs, and health/ready probes. *(Completed)*
7. Add DB indices, slow-query logging, and migration constraints.
8. Hide unfinished routes in navigation and apply role-based menu visibility.
