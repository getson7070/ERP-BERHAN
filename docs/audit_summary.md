# Initial Audit Summary

This document captures the results of an early audit of the ERP-BERHAN project when the codebase was largely undeveloped. The audit rated the repository **2/10** overall, noting that most features existed only as plans in documentation with little executable code.

## Category Scores (0â€“3)
| Area | Score | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Functional Fit | 0 | Modules described in README but not implemented. |
| UI/UX & Accessibility | 1 | Basic Bootstrap layout; lacks mobile and accessibility testing. |
| Performance & Scale | 0 | No load or concurrency tests yet. |
| Security (App & Data) | 1 | Plans for SSO/MFA/RLS but minimal code. |
| Privacy & Compliance | 0 | Policies and logging not implemented. |
| Data Quality & Integrity | 1 | Preliminary checks, but no enforcement. |
| Reporting & Analytics | 1 | Report builder scaffold only. |
| Integrations & Extensibility | 0 | No external connectors in place. |
| Telegram/Chatbot Path | 0 | Bot framework not started. |
| Files & Storage | 1 | Basic backup scripts, no object storage. |
| Deployability & DevOps | 1 | README references Docker/K8s, no CI/CD. |
| Reliability & DR | 0 | No failover or DR runbooks. |
| Observability | 1 | Prometheus metrics stubbed in app factory. |
| Testing & Quality | 0 | No automated tests at the time of audit. |
| Governance & Change Management | 0 | Lacks release notes and change control. |
| Cost & Commercials | 0 | No cost or licensing model defined. |
| Documentation & Training | 1 | Roadmap exists; lacks user/admin guides. |

## Improvement Plan
- Implement missing modules with blueprints and database schemas.
- Establish CI pipeline running linting, security scans, and pytest.
- Add integration tests and load testing scripts.
- Define security hardening steps: OAuth2, MFA, row-level security.
- Expand documentation for deployment, backups, and training.

The scores will be revisited as development progresses.
