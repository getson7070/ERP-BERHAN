# 2025 Q4 System Audit Summary

## Scope & Methodology
- Reviewed the current platform baseline described in the primary README, focusing on security controls, UI/UX affordances, resilience routines, and operational runbooks that underpin the ERP deployment.【F:README.md†L11-L112】
- Validated supporting security and governance practices documented in the security policy compendium to ensure alignment with BERHAN Pharma policies and OWASP/NIST mappings.【F:SECURITY.md†L6-L93】
- Inspected representative UI templates and design token documentation to confirm visual consistency and accessibility safeguards remain in force.【F:docs/design_system.md†L1-L24】【F:erp/templates/base.html†L1-L38】
- Examined database maintenance guidance and automation scripts that protect RPO/RTO objectives and index health, verifying coverage for backup integrity and query performance guardrails.【F:DATABASE.md†L1-L18】【F:scripts/index_audit.py†L1-L36】【F:scripts/pg_backup.sh†L1-L9】

## Strengths Observed
### Security & Compliance
- The ERP continues to enforce layered defenses including CSRF protection, rate limiting, JWT key rotation, and signed webhooks, while the published APIs are governed by an OpenAPI 3.1 contract and JSON Schema validation for inbound analytics payloads.【F:README.md†L11-L37】
- Operational security policy affirms tenant-isolated RLS, strict CSP/HSTS headers, fail-closed CI security scanning, and secret management standards with explicit exception handling, demonstrating mature governance aligned to OWASP ASVS and NIST 800-53 mappings.【F:SECURITY.md†L19-L93】

### User Experience & Accessibility
- Mobile optimization, PWA offline support, Core Web Vitals monitoring, multilingual support, and guided onboarding remain core to the product experience, supplemented by ARIA landmarks that target WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.【F:README.md†L18-L23】
- The design system tokens keep spacing and typography consistent across templates, and the base template provides clear flash messaging and input affordances for key workflows.【F:docs/design_system.md†L6-L24】【F:erp/templates/base.html†L7-L34】

### Data Integrity & Operations
- Nightly backups, index health automation, and documented RPO/RTO targets provide strong reliability coverage, while database scripts enforce sequential-scan detection and checksum validation on archived dumps.【F:README.md†L33-L37】【F:DATABASE.md†L5-L18】【F:scripts/index_audit.py†L15-L32】【F:scripts/pg_backup.sh†L1-L9】

## Gaps & Recommendations
1. **Externalize shared layout styling.** Inline styles in the base template make it harder to reuse design tokens and CSP nonce handling; migrate these styles into the central asset pipeline or component library so changes propagate consistently and reduce inline-style CSP allowances.【F:erp/templates/base.html†L7-L21】【F:docs/design_system.md†L6-L24】【F:SECURITY.md†L24-L35】
2. **Document UI regression coverage.** Although UX controls are described in the README, add a short subsection enumerating the Playwright/Pa11y smoke scenarios and their ownership to increase traceability for accessibility and responsive regressions during audits.【F:README.md†L18-L88】
3. **Augment backup verification reporting.** Extend existing backup scripts with a periodic restore validation note (e.g., checksum compare plus trial restore log) so auditors can easily trace evidence that monthly drills satisfy the documented RPO/RTO metrics.【F:DATABASE.md†L9-L18】【F:scripts/pg_backup.sh†L1-L9】
4. **Track index remediation outcomes.** Enhance the index audit workflow documentation with a pointer to where remediation tickets are logged, ensuring sequential-scan alerts from the automation feed into measurable backlog burn-down reports.【F:DATABASE.md†L5-L18】【F:scripts/index_audit.py†L15-L32】

## Next Steps
- Prioritize the styling refactor and backup verification documentation in the next sprint review, aligning with the audit roadmap's UX and resilience milestones.【F:docs/audit_roadmap.md†L13-L32】
- Circulate this summary during the upcoming Quality Management Review to confirm owners and timelines for the outlined remediation work streams.【F:docs/audit_roadmap.md†L33-L34】

## Remediation Updates (January 2026)
- Authentication and dashboard templates now source their presentation from `erp/static/css/base.css`, removing inline styles and enforcing CSP-aligned design tokens across shared layouts.【F:erp/static/css/base.css†L1-L162】【F:erp/templates/base.html†L1-L26】【F:erp/templates/dashboard.html†L1-L8】
- The README documents regression coverage for Playwright, Selenium, and Pa11y to give auditors traceable evidence of UI testing ownership.【F:README.md†L41-L51】
- `scripts/pg_backup.sh` emits custom-format dumps with manifest metadata and JSONL telemetry, satisfying the backup verification recommendation.【F:scripts/pg_backup.sh†L1-L62】
- `scripts/index_audit.py` can write JSON reports for backlog dashboards, linking sequential scan findings directly to remediation tracking.【F:scripts/index_audit.py†L1-L82】
