# Onboarding Tour

New users can follow this short tour to become familiar with the system:

1. **Sign In** – Use the credentials from the admin seed and enable MFA.
2. **Explore Navigation** – The navbar exposes modules based on your role.
3. **Change Language** – Use the locale switcher in the upper-right corner to toggle between English and Amharic.
4. **Start Guided Tour** – Click *Start Tour* in the navbar to walk through key UI elements. The tour highlights the locale switcher and theme toggle.
5. **Customize Dashboard** – Drag widgets and save your layout for quick access to frequent tasks.
6. **Inventory Walkthrough** – Visit the inventory list and try the inline edit feature with saved views (see [templates/partials/saved_views.html](../templates/partials/saved_views.html) and [static/js/saved_views.js](../static/js/saved_views.js)).
7. **Need Help?** – Click any `?` icon in the interface to reach the help page or relevant documentation.

This guide is a starting point; teams can extend it with project-specific
training material.
