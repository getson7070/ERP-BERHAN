# ISO STANDARDS INTEGRATION — MEDICAL DEVICES (Comprehensive Pack)

## 1) Why ISO certification matters in medical devices

Medical devices (surgical tools, diagnostic imaging, wearables, IVDs, and lab equipment) directly impact patient safety. Global market access (EU, USA, GCC, AU, etc.) and institutional trust often **require** or strongly expect ISO‑aligned systems. Certification and tight conformance help you:

* Reduce waste through effective quality control and right‑first‑time processes.
* Establish trust via **traceability** and **authenticity** of products.
* Meet the requirements/expectations of **EU MDR**, **US FDA QMSR/21 CFR 820**, **SFDA/GCC**, and other regulators by aligning your QMS to international norms.
* Improve production/distribution efficiency and facilitate operations.
* Strengthen decisions via structured **risk management** and data‑driven KPIs.

> **Berhan Pharma Scope Note:** Today’s scope covers **import, distribution, storage, installation/commissioning and servicing** of medical devices and IVDs (no‑design). When Berhan launches manufacturing or design activities (Class I–III), this pack already anticipates the extra controls required by **ISO 13485** and **ISO 14971**.

## 2) Which standards apply & how we comply

### ISO 13485:2016 — Medical Devices QMS

**Focus:** Regulatory‑grade QMS for devices and IVDs.
**Core clauses (illustrative mapping):**

* **4 QMS & documentation:** Controlled SOPs, records, DMS (→ BP‑QMS‑001).
* **5 Management responsibility:** Quality Policy, Objectives, **QMR** minutes and action tracking.
* **6 Resource management:** JDs, Training Matrix/records, calibration/maintenance (→ upcoming BP‑QMS‑00X; BP‑GDP‑00X Equip/Calib).
* **7 Product realization:** Supplier controls, goods receipt, storage, installation/servicing, identification & traceability, preservation (→ BP‑GDP‑002 and future Storage/Dispatch SOPs).
* **8 Measurement, analysis, improvement:** Internal audits (BP‑QMS‑003), **CAPA** (BP‑QMS‑004), complaint handling & post‑market surveillance (future BP‑QMS‑00X), mock recalls.

**Key records:** Master Document List, Training records, Supplier qualification/scorecards, GRN/traceability logs, installation/service reports, audits, CAPA, PMCF/PMS logs.

### ISO 14971:2019 — Risk Management for Medical Devices

**Focus:** Systematic **risk management** throughout lifecycle.
**Process:** Risk policy → hazard identification → risk analysis → risk evaluation → risk control → residual‑risk acceptability → **production & post‑production information** feedback (complaints, adverse events) → file maintenance.
**Embedding:** Risk is integrated into SOPs (receipt, storage, installation, service, distribution) and CAPA. Risk files exist for device families we distribute/commission.

### ISO 9001:2015 — Quality Management (organization‑wide)

**Focus:** Context, leadership, planning (risks/opportunities), support, operation, performance evaluation, improvement.
**Use:** Extends beyond device processes to **corporate** governance (HR, Finance, Sales/Tender, IT/ERP), ensuring balanced scorecard, customer focus, and process KPIs.

### ISO 14001:2015 — Environmental Management

**Focus:** Environmental aspects/impacts, compliance obligations, objectives, operational control, emergency preparedness.
**Berhan emphasis:** Packaging waste minimization & recycled content, battery/e‑waste streams for equipment, fuel/energy use, spill response, supplier environmental clauses.

### ISO 45001:2018 — Occupational Health & Safety

**Focus:** Hazard identification, OH\&S risks/opportunities, controls, consultation/participation, emergency response, incident investigation.
**Berhan emphasis:** Warehouse ergonomics & lifting, transport/loading, chemical handling, electrical safety during installation/service, PPE, incident/CAPA.

### ISO/IEC 27001:2022 — Information Security Management

**Focus:** Protect information in ERP, tender files, customer data and service logs.
**Controls (examples):** Asset inventory, access control & MFA, backups/restore tests, change management, logging/monitoring, incident response, supplier security, encryption of portable media.

* ISO 9001 (Improvement; Nonconformity & CAPA)
* Related SOPs: Document Control (BP-QMS-001), Internal Audit (BP-QMS-003)

## 4. Definitions

* **Correction:** Immediate fix to the detected nonconformity.
* **Corrective Action:** Action to remove root cause and prevent recurrence.
* **Preventive Action:** Action to eliminate potential nonconformity.
* **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** 5-Why, Fishbone, Pareto, Fault Tree.
* **Verification of Effectiveness (VoE):** Evidence that risk is controlled and recurrence prevented.

## 5. Roles & Responsibilities (RACI)

* **CAPA Coordinator (QA):** A for system oversight; ensures data integrity and timeliness.
* **CAPA Owner (Process Lead):** R to execute actions; maintain evidence.
* **Approver (QA Lead/MD):** A to approve closure after VoE.
* **All Staff:** R to report issues immediately and comply with the corporate [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## 6. Procedure

**6.1 Initiation & Logging**

* Anyone may raise a deviation/NCR using **BPF-CAPA-001** or ERP ticket; assign unique ID; categorize severity (Critical/Major/Minor) and type (Process, Document, Supplier, Temperature, IT, Safety, Other).
* Immediate **Containment** actions recorded.

**6.2 Investigation & RCA**

* CAPA Owner performs RCA using 5-Why/Fishbone with evidence; consider human factors, training, environment, equipment, methods, materials, IT.
* Document contributing causes and systemic risk.

**6.3 Action Planning**

* Define **Corrective** and **Preventive** actions with owners, due dates, required resources, and change control needs (if SOP/ERP changes required).
* Risk assess residual risk; update controls and training.

**6.4 Implementation & Evidence**

* Execute actions; attach evidence (photos, records, screenshots, training logs).
* Update ERP CAPA status.

**6.5 Verification of Effectiveness (VoE)**

* After a defined period (e.g., 30–90 days), QA verifies outcomes using data (no recurrence, KPI improvement, audit confirmation).
* If ineffective, reopen CAPA and escalate.

**6.6 Closure**

* Approver signs off when criteria met; archive CAPA pack; update trend charts.

**6.7 Trending & Reporting**

* Monthly CAPA dashboard reviewed in **QMR**: open/overdue, by source, by root cause, by severity, and effectiveness rate.

## 7. Records/Forms

* **BPF-CAPA-001** CAPA/Deviation Form
* CAPA Register (ERP)
* Evidence pack per CAPA ID

## 8. KPIs & Monitoring

* **On-time CAPA Closure** (≥ 90%)
* **Average Days to Close** (≤ 45 days)
* **Effectiveness Rate** (VoE passed on first check ≥ 85%)
* **Repeat Issue Rate** (↓ trend to zero)

## 9. Training & Competence

* All staff trained on deviation reporting; CAPA Owners trained on RCA tools; refresher annually.

## 10. Escalation

* Critical deviations immediately to MD; potential recall triggers immediate **Recall SOP** (see BP-GDP-00X when issued).
* Suppliers informed via NCR and, where appropriate, formal SCAR (Supplier CAPA).

## 11. Review

* System reviewed quarterly in QMR and annually during internal audit.
