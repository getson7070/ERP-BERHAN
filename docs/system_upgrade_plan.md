# ERP-BERHAN System Upgrade Program

## Overview
Following the comprehensive investigative audit completed in Q3 2025, this upgrade program addresses the highest impact gaps affecting performance, reliability, security, UI/UX, and data quality across ERP-BERHAN. The roadmap below sequences mandatory initiatives so that infrastructure, platform services, and business modules improve cohesively without regressing current functionality.

## Guiding Principles
- Maintain defense-in-depth by aligning with ERP-BERHAN's security baselines, RBAC/RLS enforcement, and corporate SOP controls.
- Preserve uptime through staged rollouts, blue/green deployment patterns, and comprehensive observability coverage.
- Keep the user experience consistent and accessible by following current design system standards and WCAG AA guidelines.
- Guarantee database integrity with schema governance, migration rehearsals, and performance benchmarking prior to production adoption.

## 10-Point Implementation Plan
1. **Audit Remediation & Governance Sign-off**  
   - Publish the detailed audit findings into the compliance portal, map each risk to a remediation owner, and obtain sign-off from Security, QA, and IT governance.  
   - Establish weekly status checkpoints and a risk burndown dashboard to track closure.

2. **Infrastructure Hardening & Patch Management**  
   - Upgrade base container images, host OS, and Kubernetes node pools to supported LTS versions with vendor security patches applied.  
   - Enforce CIS benchmarks via automated IaC scans, and implement immutable image signing with cosign for all deployable artifacts.

3. **Network & Access Modernization**  
   - Roll out Zero Trust network policies: mutual TLS between services, strict ingress/egress rules, and cloud firewall baselines.  
   - Centralize identity via SSO with enforced MFA, short-lived tokens, and continuous session validation in Redis-backed token revocation lists.

4. **Application Performance Optimization**  
   - Profile API and Celery workloads to identify bottlenecks, then implement async task batching, connection pooling, and caching policies.  
   - Add slow-query logging, adaptive indexing, and PgBouncer tuning to ensure P95 latency targets (<250 ms API, <1 s background) are met.

5. **Database Reliability & Lifecycle Management**  
   - Introduce schema migration pipelines with automated validation, shadow deployments, and rollback rehearsals.  
   - Implement quarterly disaster recovery drills, cross-region replication, and enhanced backup verification with checksum reporting.

6. **Secure SDLC & Dependency Hygiene**  
   - Expand CI to include SBOM generation, SAST/DAST gating, and automated dependency updates with risk scoring.  
   - Mandate signed commits, branch protection with required reviews, and automated secret scanning across repos.

7. **UI/UX Modernization Sprint**  
   - Refresh the design system with responsive layouts, accessibility audits, and updated component library aligned to industry UX standards.  
   - Conduct usability testing sessions, integrate feedback loops, and update documentation for designers and developers.

8. **Operational Observability & Incident Response**  
   - Deploy unified logging, tracing, and metrics dashboards with SLO-based alerting (availability, latency, error rate).  
   - Update incident runbooks, integrate on-call automation, and rehearse failover + chaos game days quarterly.

9. **Data Governance & Analytics Reliability**  
   - Catalog critical data assets, enforce data quality checks, and implement lineage tracking across ETL pipelines.  
   - Harden analytics refresh jobs with retry logic, audit trails, and ML model monitoring where applicable.

10. **Change Management & Training Enablement**  
    - Roll out a phased deployment plan using feature flags and blue/green or canary releases to mitigate risk.  
    - Provide cross-functional training, update SOPs, and gather post-deployment KPIs to measure adoption and performance gains.

## Success Metrics
- 100% closure of audit high/medium findings within the program timeline.  
- ≥99.9% service availability sustained during and after the rollout.  
- P95 API latency reduced by ≥30% and Celery queue depth maintained under defined thresholds.  
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities outstanding beyond SLA (30 days).  
- User satisfaction scores (SUS) improved by ≥10 points post UI/UX modernization.  
- Database recovery point objective (RPO) ≤15 minutes and recovery time objective (RTO) ≤60 minutes demonstrated in DR drills.
